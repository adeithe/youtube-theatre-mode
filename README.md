# Youtube Theatre Mode
Improve the default YouTube Theatre Mode with a layout that makes use of the full browser window.

When using theatre mode with this extension enabled, the video player will take up the full width and height of the browser. If you're watching a livestream, the chatroom will also be displayed unless closed.

The layout is designed to be as similar to the theatre mode on Twitch as possible.
